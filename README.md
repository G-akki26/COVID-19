The project covers a study of COVID-19's behaviour/trend in global regions, and indian regions along with forecasting deaths and positive cases with various methods. 

The *study and forecast* on **world level data** is done for duration of **Jan 22, 2020 to April 19, 2020**, while on indian-region level data is done till May 19, 2020.

***EDA*** for both of the can be found on the **[notebook](https://github.com/G-akki26/COVID-19/blob/master/COVID_19.ipynb)** in repo.

## Forecasting
For the former following methods were used to forecast:
  - SARIMA
  - Facebook's Prophet Model
  - Linear Regression
  - LightGBM
  - Exponential Smoothing using Holt-Winters' Method or Triple Exponential smoothing

For Indian regions, following methods were used for forecasting:
  - Exponential Smoothing using Holt-Winters' Method or Triple Exponential smoothing
  - Facebook's Prophet Model
  - LightGBM
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - LASSO Regularisation
  - Ridge Regression
